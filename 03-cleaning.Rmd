# Data transformation

Data for this project is sourced from the following link:   https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/gender-statistics  
  
The CSV files were downloaded from the "Data & Resources" tab and imported directly into RStudio for processing. The specific steps taken to process the data for visualization differed between the three topics studied for this project: social rights, education, and employment. Since there is information for over 200 regions, the project selected 30 to analyze their changes over time. Out of the 30 selected countries, 5 belonged to each continent. These countries were randomly selected.  
  
The selected countries are:  
North America: Canada, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, United States  
South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay  
Europe: Belarus, Iceland, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Ukraine  
Asia: China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand  
Africa: Rep. Congo, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zimbabwe  
Oceania: Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa  
  
For social rights,  
  
  
For education,  
  
  
For employment, the specific features selected from the data set included the employment to population ratio of males and females aged 15+ from model ILO estimates, the female share of employment in upper/middle management, the Women business and the law index, and the female/male employment ratio. The Women business and the law index had no missing values. 2010-2019 averages were used for data visualization for the other features where some values were missing.
