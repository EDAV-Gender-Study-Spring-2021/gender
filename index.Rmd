# Introduction

In 2016, the American presidential election became the most heated topic around the world. On one hand, the support rates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were very close, making the result hard to predict. If Hillary won the election, she would be the first women president in the American history. Hillary did not end up winning the presidential election but it is noteworthy that an extremely imbalanced gender distribution existed in specific working fields such as the president. Whether the gender discrimination exists worldwide and to what extent is gender discrimination present seem to be a interesting subject worthy to be explored. In this project, we want to gain a overall perception on gender discrimination in the world by mainly seeking the answers for three sub-questions through exploratory data analysis:

1) How do women's social status compare to men's social status in modern society from a variety of standpoints like social rights, education, and employment?

2) How has women's social status changed in the last 30 years (years data is available for) regarding social rights, education, and employment?  

3) What are the differences and developments in women's social status between different countries in recent years? Does GDP (or other developmental / geographical factors) have an influence on equal rights. What are plausible explanations for gender discrepancies from the perspective of different countries?  

Owing to the data availability for countries, we used only 30 countries with high quality data to do the analysis, each country was randomly chosen from 6 continents. We hope the situations in these countries can somehow reflect the gender discrepancies as a whole around the world.
