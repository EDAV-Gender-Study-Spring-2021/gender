# Conclusion

For social rights:
1.Iceland, Canada and New Zealand do well. No obvious gender discrimination in finance and freedom, but marked gender discrimination is found in social welfare these year. 
2.World started to focus on solving the gender discrimination problem at around 1987. The gender discrimination decreased a lot during last 40 years. And in the law and welfare aspects, the discrimination moderated rapidly yet still exists. 
3.GDP has no influence on the gender discrimination in social rights aspects while the location of the country will, to some extent, determine the gender discrimination condition in social rights aspect. Generally, the North America will have a higher scores in the majority of topics)

Some limitations:
1.Owing to the availability of the data, we only sampled 30 countries from different continents in the world. The analysis result may not be representative for the whole world. 
2.The number of social rights questions asked by the dataset provider is not large enough (only 24), so the analysis result may be limited and only can reflect partial conditions of the worldwide social rights for women.
3.Maybe when more data are available, we can explore more about the same topic.
(Analysis limitation)
4.The assignment of questions to topics is quite subjective. Maybe there are some better assignments for the questions to the topics.
