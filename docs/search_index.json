There are no missing values for v1, v2, and v4 as they are model ILO estimates, so some values are interpolated by the World Bank. Even though v3 has a ton of missing values, the proportion of females to males in upper/middle management relative to the proportion of females to males in the workforce appears to be a strong indicator for discrepancies in employment opportunities, so a decision was made to keep the feature for analysis. Out of the 30 countries selected, 12 countries had no information on the proportion of females in upper/middle management and they were excluded from the analysis that followed. "]]
